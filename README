An ant colony is an underground lair where ants live. Colonies consist of a
series of underground chambers, connected to each other and the surface of the
earth by small tunnels. There are rooms for nurseries, food storage, and
mating. The colony is built and maintained by legions of worker ants, who
carry tiny bits of dirt in their mandibles and deposit them near the exit of
the colony, forming an ant-hill. Food carried in by workers is retrieved from
the surrounding environment and can be traced from colony to colony by the use
of isotopes.
